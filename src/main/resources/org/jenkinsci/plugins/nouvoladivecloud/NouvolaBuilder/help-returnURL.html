	Nouvola Divecloud plugin uses Nouvola's webhook service. In order to get a callback from the webhook service once the tests
are completed, you will need to give a web url that the webhook service can send its payload to. If you do not have one, the Jenkins job will exit once a test plan is successfully triggered without waiting for a callback.
